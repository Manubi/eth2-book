## Outline
- Ethereum allows for three primary client types
- Archival nodes
    - Store everything that's ever happened
- Full nodes
    - Store everything in the current state
    - Usually does not include very old state, like deleted storage or history of changes (old wiki lists > 1k blocks, not sure what people settled on)
- Light clients
    - Sort of a thing in Eth1, but not as good as bitcoin SPV b/c more info needed to verify
    - Need to research this a little more
