title: "Limitations"

Ok so theres a big limitation mainly on the extent to which this system can scale right. The way eth1 works is that there's one big chain and users on the chain need to validate everything in order to use it. We say this is O(n) validation since we need to look at all N of the data on chain. This is a big thing we tackle in Eth2 where we try to isntead of this require that users can only verify a subset of the total data but still be sure that the total data is ging to be accurate.
