DRAFT STATUS: 0/5

The beacon chain is the core of the Eth2 system. It handles the main logic that allows validators to stake, perform actions, and be rewarded or punsiehd. It is necessary for all other components of the chain to function. The beacon chain does not handle applications itself, but makes it possible for applications to exist.

The beacon chain is an implementation of the Proof of Stake protocol in Eth2. It has blocks and state, and the consensus process about these blocks is defined by the PoS protocol. We look at the details of these blocks and state later, as well as the actual way that validators interact with the beacon chain.
