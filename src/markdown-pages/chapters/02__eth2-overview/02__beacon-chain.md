Eth1 is just one big chain. Everyting about Eth1 is handled on that one chain. In Eth2, we add a separate main chain caleldl the beacon Chain. THe Beacon CHain handles all of the logical stuff that kesp tehr est of the chain running. Mainyl this is stuff about validators, it's where validators make votes, where valdiators get paid, etc. Not really something we had to worry about in Eth1.
