## Outline
- Spoke mainly about people actually proposing things
    - These are called miners, proposers, validators
    - Generally required to run "full nodes" that track everything
- But obviously must have people doing actions, not necessarily be miners
    - Non-miner participants can make changes to state
    - Can run "full nodes" if desired
    - Can also run "light nodes" with reduced guarantees
- Can also be non-participant observer
    - Any? Maybe even archival.
