# The Eth2 Book: Guide for Reviewers
Hello! Thank you for taking the time to review this work. Feedback is an extremely valuable element of the writing process, and we wouldn't be able to produce a widely useful resource without it. We've created this guide to help you get familiar with the goals for the project, the current status of the work, and our particular review process.

The Eth2 book is largely a work in progress and is subject to significant change over the coming months. The specific type of review we're looking for will, as a result, also change as the project progresses. We'll update this guide as those feedback needs shift.

All reviewers will be credited within the final work :blush:.

## Project Overview
Eth2 documentation and technical knowledge is, currently, spread thinly across various corners of the internet. Existing resources are often difficult to discover via simple searches. Some attempts have been made to collect links to resources within research "indices," but these projects often go unmaintained after only a short period of time. More accessible documents tend to fall into the extremes of overly-technical or overly-simplistic writing.

The Eth2 Book is an extensive educational resource that aims to tackle these issues and, as a result, become the go-to location for anyone looking to understand Eth2 in depth. By collecting, parsing, and presenting Eth2 knowledge under a single (digital) roof with a consistent written voice, The Eth2 Book will vastly simplify the on-boarding process for potential new Eth2 contributors.

## Review Process
We're experimenting with a few potential options for our review process. Currently, we're asking reviewers to use [Hypothesis](https://hypothes.is/), a browser extension that allows users to leave comments or highlights on webpages. Hypothesis comments are by default published to a "public" group, but we've created a separate [review group](https://hypothes.is/groups/ijW5BGmi/eth2-book-external-review) in order to keep the comment space clean. Once you've joined the review group, make sure to click the "Public" dropdown at the top of the extension overlay and select the group as your current comment space.

Since Hypothesis comments are subdomain-specific, we host different "major" versions of the book on different subdomains. We can therefore maintain older comments without losing context when large-scale edits are published. For simplicity, we've provided a redirect link so that the latest version of the project can always be found at (https://eth2-latest.incessant.ink).

## Draft Status System
Our project uses a "draft status" system, in which pages are given ratings for completeness on a scale of zero to five. The status of any given draft, along with the meaning of that status, can be found at the top of the draft's page. 

Draft status levels are:

| Status Rating | Status Meaning                                       |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 0             | NOT PUBLISHED                                        |
| 1             | NOT REVIEWED                                         |
| 2             | REVIEWED INTERNALLY, CONTENT STRUCTURE NOT FINALIZED |
| 3             | CONTENT STRUCTURE FINALIZED                          |
| 4             | READY FOR FINAL EDITS                                |
| 5             | FINAL DRAFT                                          |

## Project Status
We've chosen to release content within the Eth2 Book on a rolling basis. Our first planned release will include the following chapters:

0. Introduction
1. Eth1 Overview
2. Eth2 Overview
3. Proof of Stake in Eth2
4. Building Blocks
5. The Beacon Chain

At the moment, early drafts for most of these chapters have been completed. However, much of the content within these chapters is still subject to change.

## Feedback Needs
We currently have a strong need for:

- **High-Level Structural Review**
    - Overall structure/ordering of topics within the book.
    - Big topics overlooked within these first chapters.
- **Low-Level Content Review**
    - Important details overlooked within specific sections.
    - Topics requiring additional details or exposition.
    - Technical errors or inconsistencies in explanations or diagrams.
    - Locations in which additional diagrams would be useful.
    - Locations in which additional mathematical proofs would be useful.
- **Presentation Review**
    - Suggestions for website improvements.
    - Bugs in webpages.
    - Accessibility or readability issues.

As content is still heavily in flux, we are asking that, for the moment, reviewers **avoid**:

- **Grammatical Review**
    - Spelling errors.
    - Confusing or incorrect grammatical structure.
- **Stylistic Review**
    - General comments on language style.
    - Confusing and inconsistent style between paragraphs.
    - Problems with flow between ideas or sections.

## Thank You!
Once again, thank you so much for your time here! As previously stated, all reviewers will be credited within the final work.
